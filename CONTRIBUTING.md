# Contribution Guidelines

Hey there! Welcome to Hacktoberfest Animations! Here you can create your very own animation and share it with the world! Please read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/NiallEccles/Hacktoberfest-animations/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to add your animation
- Fork this repo
- Create a new CSS file with your cool animation name inside `./animations` folder, be creative!
- Edit the `./animations.js` file to include your animation using the following structure:
```js
{
    name: 'the-name-of-your-animation',
    author: 'your-github-username'
}
```
<sub>**PS**: the animation name should have the same name of your CSS file.</sub><br>
<sub>**PS²**: although it is not necessary to include your object alphabetically (there is a function that will do this automatically afterwards), it is recommended that you do so to keep the project organized.</sub><br>
<sub>**PS³**: use the same name of your CSS file as your animation class. Example: a file named `my-cool-animation.css` containing a `.my-cool-animation` class inside.</sub>
- DONE!
